# i3 IPC

My IPC controller for i3. All of the connection code is in `src/ipc_socket.ts`. All my custom logic is located in `src/logic/`.

Built using NodeJS and TypeScript.

## TODO

- [ ] Convince Alacritty to let me open a new terminal in the same directory as an existing instance
- [ ] Work with keepassxc
- [ ] Might make per-screen workspaces, as that's what I'm more familiar with
- [ ] Integrate with my own [project selector](https://github.com/sharpdev-me/rofi-project-browser)
